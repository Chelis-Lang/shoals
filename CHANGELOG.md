# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format
follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and
this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.1] — unreleased

Version-track reset and dep cascade. Shoals's package version is now
on its own independent track; the prior 0.7.x labelling was
inherited from chelis's compiler version and overstated maturity.
Future minor bumps reflect Shoals's own milestone progression, not
the compiler pin.

### Changed

- `reef.toml`:
  - `version`: `0.7.6` → `0.0.1` (track reset; Shoals is pre-foundations).
  - `compiler`: `=0.7.6` → `=0.7.11` (matches the compiler pin
    declared by nautilus 0.7.13 / coral 0.7.13).
  - `nautilus`: `0.7.6` → `0.7.13`.
  - `coral`: `0.7.6` → `0.7.13`.
- `chelis-std` stays at `0.3.0` (compiler-bundled; only changes when
  a release moves it).
- Reformatted `src/curves.ch`, `src/orderbook.ch`, `tests/orderbook.ch`
  to the canonical formatter shape under chelis 0.7.11 (multi-line
  match expressions). No semantic change.

### Upstream status

- The `grad-eval-host-runtime` upstream bug closed 2026-05-07
  (chelis commit `412fa61`); the host runtime now supports `grad`
  via delegation to the C backend's lowering machinery. The Shoals
  deferral hedges in `properties/greeks.ch`, `README.md`, and
  `spec/phase3l.md` were tied to a two-part condition: (a) host
  runtime supports `grad` — now resolved; (b) Shoals's pricing body
  (which uses `to_list` + `map` over a host-lane list combinator)
  lowers cleanly under host-runtime `grad` — not verified at M0 and
  remains the gating condition. The hedge text is left intact at M0;
  re-evaluation belongs to a future milestone that actually
  exercises a grad-derived Greek property.
- `phase5_host_scalar_ad.md` remains a future performance
  optimisation, not a correctness blocker.

### Plan-scope context

This release implements **M0** of `docs/plan-quant-surface.md`. It
ships no new functional surface; subsequent milestones (M1+) build
out distributions, dates, calendars, tenors, multi-curve, vol
surfaces, advanced SDE, the pricer zoo, Greeks discipline, XVA,
calibration, and advanced risk per `spec/shoals_quant_surface.md`.

## [0.7.6] — 2026-05-11

Compiler and dependency alignment release. Tracks chelis 0.7.6,
chelis-std 0.3.0, nautilus 0.7.6, and coral 0.7.6. CI now consumes
released Chelis artifacts only, installs released Nautilus and Coral
packages, and runs the native Shoals suite as
`chelis test tests/ --timeout 120 --jobs auto`.

Validation recorded in `docs/testing_cutover_0.7.6.json`:

- `chelis test tests/ --timeout 120 --jobs auto`: 48 passed, 0 failed, 1:04.89
- `chelis test tests/ --timeout 120 --jobs 1`: 48 passed, 0 failed, 1:25.44

### Changed

- Replaced the stale blanket host-runtime AD limitation with scoped
  documentation: Shoals keeps executable Greek coverage on finite
  differences, while `Shoals.Pricing`'s grad-derived Greeks remain a
  deferred runtime path until the full pricing body is IR-lowerable by
  host-runtime `grad`.
- Scoped the default Shoals CI/local gate to formatter checks,
  `chelis reef build`, and the node-local runtime suite.

## [0.3.1] — 2026-05-06

Compiler-pin alignment release. Tracks chelis 0.6.0 → 0.6.1
(bootstrap-list patch), nautilus 0.6.0 → 0.6.1, and coral 0.6.0 →
0.6.1 (companion alignments). No source changes from 0.3.0 — only
version + pin bumps.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-05-06

Naming-convention release. Aligns shoals with the recorded style
guide in `chelis/spec/01-nomenclature.md`. Track-forward for
chelis 0.6.0 / chelis-std 0.2.0 / nautilus 0.6.0 / coral 0.6.0.

### Changed — `Nautilus.SDE` → `Nautilus.Sde` reference update

Two references in `spec/phase3l.md` updated from `Nautilus.SDE` to
`Nautilus.Sde` per nautilus's §6.2 Title-case-not-ALL-CAPS rename.
No other shoals source files referenced the renamed surfaces.

### Style guide — §7.1.1 model/algorithm sub-namespace prefixes recognized

The `bs_*` (Black-Scholes pricing), `mc_*` (Monte-Carlo pricing),
`gbm_*` (geometric Brownian motion), and `fd_*` (finite-difference
numerical method) prefixes used in `Shoals.Pricing`, `Shoals.Stochastic`,
and `Shoals.Properties.Greeks` are now formally recognized as §7.1.1
model/algorithm sub-namespaces in `chelis/spec/01-nomenclature.md`.
The chelis-lint `MODEL_NAMESPACE_PREFIXES` allowlist accepts them.
The closer-read step from the original cleanup brief settled on
"Outcome A" — keep the prefixes as load-bearing model-discrimination,
not as helper-marker violations.

(That phrasing — "load-bearing" — is the kind shoals's Black-Scholes
trader would find compelling. The author of these conventions
prefers more concrete framing: dropping the prefixes would conflate
distinct mathematical objects in a single function-name namespace.
Either phrasing leads to the same call.)

### Changed — pin bumps for the upstream rename chain

`reef.toml`:
- `compiler = "=0.5.0"` → `"=0.6.0"`
- `chelis-std = { version = "0.1.0" }` → `{ version = "0.2.0" }`
- `nautilus = { version = "0.5.0" }` → `{ version = "0.6.0" }`
- `coral = { version = "0.5.0" }` → `{ version = "0.6.0" }`

All four pins must move together — partial bumps fail the gate
because shoals's callers reach into the renamed surfaces in coral
and the renamed-module imports in nautilus.

### Style guide

Adheres to `chelis/spec/01-nomenclature.md`. Local `STYLE.md` is a
one-line pointer at the central guide.
